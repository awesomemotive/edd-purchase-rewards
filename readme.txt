Increase sales and build customer loyalty by rewarding customers

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). 

EDD Purchase Rewards allows a site owner to reward customers who purchase with a discount code. This will not only lead to repeat sales by the customer, but build customer loyalty. 

The discount code can either be a preselected discount code that you create, or you can choose to automatically generate a unique, on-time use discount code (percentage or flat rate).

A minimum purchase amount can be set, and you can also force the customer to share to at least 1 social network before the discount is given to them. The discount code is shown on the purchase confirmation page but can be optionally emailed to the customer.
